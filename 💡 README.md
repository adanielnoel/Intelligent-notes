# Readme
This vault is meant for gathering notes using a modernized Zettlecasten methodology. 

There are five types of notes:
1. **Fleeting**: stores temporary content.
2. **Literature**: contains a single idea from another source.
3. **Permanent**: contains a single own idea.
4. **Index**: collects notes around a similar topic.
5. **Keyword**: collects notes under a title (a book, a WIP, etc.) or category (quotes, essays, etc.).
6. **Citation**: see [[#Citations]]

Types 1 to 3 should be very short notes dedicated to a single idea, like building blocks.
Types 4 and 5 should be used to assemble those building blocks into new complex ideas.

Methodology inspired on [this](https://medium.com/@rebeccawilliams9941/the-zettelkasten-method-examples-to-help-you-get-started-8f8a44fa9ae6) and [this](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/) blog posts.

> Internal links are coloured in render mode according to the type of the note they point to.

## Creating a note
Each type has a folder for its notes. If right-clicking the folder to create a new note, a template will be applied automatically with the date and tag.

Alternatively, the right template can be applied to a new blank note by the hotkey `ctrl+SHIFT+#` where `#` is replaced by the index of the note type. For instance, `ctrl+SHIFT+2` inserts the *Literature note template*. Templates can be found under `External files/`.

## Tag system
Tags are used for adding metadata about:
- **The type of note**:
	1. `#type/fleeting`
	2.  `#type/literature`
	3.  `#type/permanent`
	4.  `#type/index`
	5.  `#type/keyword`
	6.  `#type/citation_note`
- **Content topics**:
	1. `#idx/information_theory`
	2. `#idx/deep_learning`
	3. . . . or any other user-defined topic, always starting with `#idx/`
- **Content categories or keywords**:
	1. `#cat/people`
	2. `#cat/quote`
	3. . . . or any other user-defined category, always starting with `#cat/`
- **File flags**:
	1. `#flags/no_source`
	2. `#flags/incomplete`
	3. `#flags/hypothetical`
	4. `#flags/wip`
	5. `#flags/publishable`
	6. `#flags/published`

> Type and flag tags are hard-coded in the stylesheets and are not meant to be changed (it's possible but it takes some work; see `snippets/supercharged_internal_links.css` and `snippets/metatable.css`).

> Content topics will typically have an associated index note

> Tags are only used in the metadata section, never in the note's content.

> `#flags/no_source` is used for literature notes when no source is needed (else, a literature note without any source will be listed in [[⚠️ problematic notes#Literature notes without citations]]).
> `#flags/incomplete` is used on any note that needs reviewing.
> The other `#flags/` subtags are meant for qualifying personal notes but they are not required.

### Index and category notes
These notes will gather notes that have certain tags. The templates contain scripts to pull notes with the with one or more of the index/category tags specified in the note's metadata.

## Note metadata
The note metadata will contain at least the creation date and note type tag (both inserted automatically by the templates). Additional tags and aliases can be added manually. Aliases are useful to provide alternative names for linking. For instance:
```
<information entropy>
---
date_created: "13 Aug 2021"
tags: [type/literature, idx/information_theory]
aliases: [self information]
---
```

## Problematic notes
The tag system is designed to enforce some consistency on the note-taking system. Notes that do not conform to the rules of the tag system are automatically listed in [[⚠️ problematic notes]].

## Plugins

### Citations
This plugin automatically pulls metadata from a bibtex library generated by Mendeley or another reference manager and creates notes for those entries when needed. These notes use the citation key as title and contain the metadata of the reference. The template for these notes is in the *Citations* plugin settings.
- `ctrl+SHIFT+6` Create a citation note
- `ctrl+SHIFT+O` Create a citation note (alternative hot key)
- `ctrl+SHIFT+E` Add a reference to a citation note (if it doesn't exist, it creates it automatically)

### Dataview
Enables scripting inside notes using javascript. See any index or keyword note for examples.
